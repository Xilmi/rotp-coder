    Custom serialized for java.awt.Color !!!

=======================

* Artifact, Ultra Rich and Rich don't transport population

* Autotransport slider:
0% on the slider is "as soon as it is possible"
50% on the slider is "planet is at 50% population"
100% on the slider is "planet population is at 100%"

* Stop research once Future Tech X is discoverd, force all
output to industry (reserve)
