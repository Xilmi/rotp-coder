Balance (Experimental):

All missiles got their size, power-requirements and cost reduced to 2/3rd of their previous values, allowing to fit more of them onto a ship.
Missile-bases now have a fixed cost of 120 BC.

Governor:

Will no longer send auto-transports to colonies further than 8 turns away.

UI:

Reversed swapping of "Yes"- and "No"-button on bombard-dialogue when orbiting non-hostile empire's colonies.

AI:

Improved logic about when ships with missiles will retreat or not.
Will once again offer a tech for a trade again if there's a new tech it could trade it for.
When getting into a war before having basic war-techs will now rather try to risk rushing the techs instead of wasting resources on building lots of base-tech-ships.
Simplified tech-selection-logic. This is experimental and likely worse than before.
Fixed an issue where current colonization-tech was considered obsolete.
Will no longer send transports to colonies further than 8 turns away.
Fixed that projector-specials weren't taken into account for retreat-logic-calculation.
