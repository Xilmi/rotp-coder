No longer trying to dodge missiles as that didn't work as intended and messed with retreat-logic.
Changed targetting logic to prefer closer targets which proves as the better decision when trying to kite.
No longer trying to still do damage when incoming missiles are the reason for wanting to retreat.
Use the maximum possible damage of incoming missiles rather than the average when considering to retreat from them due to being destroyed otherwise.
More gradual damage estimates against ships that are faster have more range instead of the binary all- or nothing-approach.
Ignore auto-repair when checking whether the enemy could kill a ship within one turn.
