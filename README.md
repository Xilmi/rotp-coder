UI:

When changing someone's color during an ongoing game you now have all 16 options.

AI:

Got rid of the hard-coded rush for certain techs recently introduced. Instead it was replaced by the AI now knowing whether a tech is a military-tech or not and using a separate military-tech-level to decide whether to go to war and whether to rush techs or build military.
Fixed an issue with AI automatically wanting to offer peace when it needs more colony-ships than it has.
Fixed an issue where positioning fleets during peace-time was undecisive and often led to fleets being out of position when a war started.
