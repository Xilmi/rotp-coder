UI:

When the oribital-bombardment-dialogue comes up while you are in orbit of a faction you are not currently at war with, it will no longer refer to them as enemies, asks it's question in a red text and has the "Yes"- and "No"-buttons swapped. This should avoid accidentally bombarding someone who you are at peace with.
The game over-screen will now display the "Replay"- and "Exit"-buttons immediately instead of forcing you to wait until the fade-in-animation is completed.

AI:

AI now is much more reserved about trading away techs and will only trade away techs that are outdated to itself except to it's allies, where their behaviour doesn't change.
The distance at which missiles should be fired now depends on how close to a corner the opponent already is.
Fixed an issue where ships would not always kite in tactical combat when they should.
Feeling threatened by a potential attack now also triggers trying to rush out the core-techs deemed required for successfull warfare.
Will no longer all-in on fleet-building when technologically behind.
Designs with bombs now can once again be built without having the core-techs deemed required for successfull warfare.
