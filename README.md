UI:

There now is a forecast for population about to be killed during bombardement.
Disabling the governor will now also clear all locked spending-categories.
Mass-enabling governor from the colonies-screen via hotkey "g" or "ctrl+g" now also runs the governor imediately to be consistent with what happens when you enable it on the system.
Bombing a planet with bio-weapons in tactical combat, when the planet has sufficient antidote-tech will now display "Immune" instead of "Miss".

Bugfixes:

Fixed an issue where the governor would still stop ship-production completely when building defenses.
Fixed an issue where switching on the governor when it wanted to build defenses could lead to a total-allocation exceeding 100%.
Fixed incorrect application of antidotes against biological weapons fired in tactical-combat.
Fixed that extinct empires could invade with transports that arrive at this turn and turn into ghost-empires as consequence.

AI:

General:
During a tech-trade, when there's more than 3 options for techs to be selected to trade in for something else, it will now show the three options closest in tech-cost to the tech that is about to be exchanged.
After bombing a colonizable system while not having a colonizer in the fleet, a fighting-capable ship will be left there until it is driven off or the system is colonized.

Expert:
AI will no longer offer alliances before it knows at least two other factions.
