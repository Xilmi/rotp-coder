UI:

Planets with an active governor will no longer annoy the player when something is ready.

Bugfixes:

Fixed an issue that prevented abandoning colonies.
Fixed an issue where governed planets would forget that they were building ships when the governor upgrades them.
Fixed an issue where governed planets would start building shields if there are no missile-bases.

AI:

General:
AI will not offer the same techs to trade to the player that the player previously refused to trade for. It will only contact the player if it has something new. Player can still contact the AI to ask for trades about stuff they have been offered before.
