Game ending:

Fixed that the game would not end if all factions are allied during auto-play.
"Alliance Win" and "Military Alliance Win" have been renamed to "Survival as vassal" and "Survival as part of alliance" to reflect that the game was not really won.

AI:

Fixed an issue that caused Meklonar-AI to not build as many factories as it could.
Ship-designs that previously would have been pure fighters will now get equipped with at least one of the most modern bombs.
No longer investing reserves into systems that are generating reserves.
Don't scrap entire fleet at once after a destructive ultra-late-game war. Instead only scrap when the reserve is used up and only scrap one design at a time.
Fixed some issues in regards to researching future-techs.
When there's no techs left to research all planets should build ships.
Rush the techs necessary for a rush even if a rush is not intended.
Increased value of useless techs from 0 to 1 as 0 now is used for halting the research of non-essential techs when going for rush-techs and we don't want to halt researching a tree completely just because a tech within it is uselss.
Desired ship-maintenance now differs between 1v1 and games with more factions. In 1v1 the amount of ships to be made is more all-in. In games with more factions it should strike a balance between commiting as much as necessary into ship-production but not more.
No longer generally defending uncolonized systems.
Selection of opponents to go after now considers a bunch of additional factors. In particular their power, the power of their allies and the power of their opponents.
Now will avoid wars in free-for-all, when they don't look easily winable.
The more ahead one particular factions gets, the more the others will become open to form an alliance with everyone who wants it and try to go for survival as vassal or part of alliance.
As part of such alliance the AI will operate almost as a unity, never betray their allies and fight their opponents together to the bitter end.
