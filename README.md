Bugfix:

Fixed an error in the AI that caused AI-ships with at least one empty weapon-slot not to bombard planets with missile-bases.

AI:

No longer rushing military-techs before running into another empire.
Planets within extended-fuel-tank-range are now also taken into consideration when deciding whether to get colonization-technologies.
Now considering the quality of the own ship-designs when deciding whether one should sue for peace due to being outmatched.
