Fixed an issue where stacks without repulsors would think they can repel ships without anti-ship-weapons from attacking the planet.
Fixed an issue where unarmed ships would initiate a combat to then retreat anyways.
Hit-chance now taken into consideration for the calculations of whether a colony can be destroyed by bombers during combat.
No longer kiting ships that can't shoot back anyways.
During target-selection the score for ships is no longer divided by distance if the ship shouldn't be kited anyways.
Fixed an issue that caused bombers to be laregely ignored if other targets were available.
The decision to stay in a losing battle due to hopes of destroying the enemy colony now depends soley on the life-expectency of our dedicated bombers rather than our entire fleet.
Single ships staying in until their hitpoints are low now are only half as brave and will retreat when they expect to be killed in less than 2 turns rather than one.
