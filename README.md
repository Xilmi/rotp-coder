General:

Include not yet merged changes from official 1.04.

AI:

Fixed an issue where the AI would not retreat from a missile base when it couldn't damage it.
Fixed an issues that prevented holding on to a cheap fighter-design to repell scouts.
Fixed a rare issue where the AI could end up spending in ships while not actually producing ships.

Legacy:

Will now immediately start getting essential war-techs when in contact with opponent instead of only doing so when wanting to go to war or opponent having declared war.
When one or more of the essential war-techs are too expensive (more than 5 times the total production of the empire), which usually happens if they are not present in the first two tiers, they are no longer seen as requirement for commiting to military.
