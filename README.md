Game-Options / Balance:

The size-, cost- and power-usage of missiles as well as the cost of missile-bases can now be altered in the MOD Options. The range is between 10% and 100%. Referring to the size/cost/power-usage in the base-game. The default is set to 66% for now.

AI:

Rookie:

Missile-size-factor is now taken into account for how many missile-bases to build. The lower the multiplier the more bases will be built.

Advanced/Legacy:

Systems that have built shields will now also build at least one missile-base. If missile-bases are cheap enough more than one may be built.
Improvements to the new tech-selection-logic: When there's several options for the same tech-type, the one with the highest level is prefered.
