New Option:

You can now set whether retreating shall be restricted for AI, player, both and of course noone. Default is "None".
You can now set the amount of turns that a restricted player cannot retreat for. Default is 100 turns, the maximum amount of combat-turns.

UI:

The retreat button before combat is no longer available when retreating is restricted for the player.
The retreat all-button during combat is now greyed out and shows a countdown when retreating is restricted for the player.
