Governor:

Fixed an issue where the governor would build star-gates above everything else even on completely undeveloped colonies.

AI:

When comparing the powerlevel of their own fleets to that of their enemies for the purpose of determining whether more ships should be built, the AI now devalues their own ships based on how outdated they are. So they will no longer assume having enough military based on overrating their outdated designs.
When adding a cloaking-device to a colony-ship wouldn't change the required hull-size the AI now adds them so that their fleets can't be seen when they are accompanied by colony-ships.
Fixed an issue where stacks that were unreachable doe to the path being blocked by other stacks, asteroids or repulsors were still considered as potential targets.
Stacks immobilized by warp-dissipators are no longer taken into consideration for retreat-calculation of their still mobile friends.
