The [race] Hive
The year is 3374...

You gaze upon the innumerable stars above your head, the same stars you have looked upon for more than three thousand years. The same stars that greeted you when you first opened your eyes alone on Kholdan, and the same stars that have sheltered you as you have grown into an unstoppable force that has shaped the entire planet as you've seen fit. 
Yet, through all the years that you have learned about yourself and the innumerable bodies that your consciousness inhabits, you have never seen another intelligent lifeform anywhere else on this world, and so have been unerringly driven to make your way into space to find what answers, and other lifeforms, it holds. You have never known differing thoughts or ideas, never known war or deception, and never known opposition to your will and all the things that it entails. 
With hope and trepidation, you look to the heavens on the eve before your story takes its next and largest leap forward since it first began. Will you find the answers to how and why you came to be? Will you find others like you who can build, grow, and dream? Or will you find nothing more than danger and strife in a universe so much larger than yourself that it is beyond your own unlimited imagination...
