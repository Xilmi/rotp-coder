MAIN_ADVISOR_TITLE                | %1 Advisor
MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | We have finished construction on a pair of scouts and a colony ship. Let us hope the answers we seek present themselves on a nearby world.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | No answers found on the planet %1. We should still grow our numbers there by sending any transports we can spare.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | Representatives of a people native to this plane have made themselves known. We must do all we can to learn any answers they possess.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | We have uncovered a way to produce more efficient engines. We must reach a consensus on how best to update our ship designs to utilize this new technology.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | An unavoidable conflict has begun! Our production facilities can direct their newly built ships to rally to a single world and form a fleet there to defend us from the aggressors.
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | We have lost too much in coming to this universe to lose any more now: have our colonies protect themselves from enemies by building as many defensive missile bases as they can.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | We've discovered new technology that improves the offensive capabilities of our starships. We must again decide how to update our ship designs to take advantage of this as soon as possible.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | There are rumors of a gathering known as the Galactic Council which will soon occur. Our spies hope to use it as an opportunity to gather any intelligence they can. The future of our race depends on it!
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | Have the people of %1 lost their minds?! They forget that only together can we prevail in this universe! We must make an example of this rebellion immediately!
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | Our odds of success here were always known to be slim. Fighting against the Galactic Council and its allies does little to hinder our chances.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | We have worked for too long to bend these fools to our will! Rebellion against our leadership cannot be tolerated! Destroy them at once!

GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | The end of your quest, the end of your people...#A tragedy unimaginable has befallen your empire. Once a race desperate to uncover the secrets of the event that flung your forebears from their dying universe into this alien dimension, your civilization lies in total ruin at the feet of denizens far more powerful than you could hope to stand against. If they had but known your plight, they may have been more merciful, perhaps even rendering you aid, or at least more tolerant of the means you used to achieve your ends. Instead you have achieved only the untimely death of your kind as other powers continue their march into whatever the future holds for them.#Alas that the Darloks should meet this doom! Had you played your hand differently, your people may still be alive and may even have found the key that would allow you to bring the rest of your race into this new, more stable plane. Perhaps, though, your cards could not have been played better: perhaps fate had simply decided to deal you a most unfortunate hand...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | The first phase finished, the true test begins...#This galaxy is yours! Just as your people dominated the universe they came from, so too have you crushed the feeble opposition in this galaxy and claimed all that it contains as your own. The tactics that you employed proved too much for your foes to overcome, and the stealth and secrecy you employed to gain their secrets proved even more so. Now, as the last strongholds of your enemies fall beneath your might, you look out over the stars that litter what will become the Darloks' permanent home.#But your work is not yet close to complete. You have learned how to live in this alien dimension and made an entire galaxy safe for your people to inhabit and prosper. However, the secrets of the interdimensional rift that brought your race here in the first place has yet to be uncovered, and every day that passes here means that your home universe comes closer to its inevitable collapse. And should any of the empires you destroyed have had the secret already, your military conquest may yet have proved to be your undoing...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | The first phase finished, the true test begins...#Now is the hour of your first true victory! When your people were thrown into this dimension, they found it frightening, alien, and dangerous. But rather than cower and eke out a living as best they could, they boldly went forward, vowing to master this galaxy's secrets and make it secure to bring over the rest of your people from their dying plane. Along the way, enemies and friends were made, and the stage was set for the greatest challenge your people would ever come to know.#Together with your allies you have succeeded in dismantling those who would oppose your goals and breaking them upon your fleets like the tide breaks against the shore. Now only you and your close friends remain, and through the kinship that can only be gained by sharing in the victory of war, you will happily aid your allies in their burdens as they will aid you in yours. And once your people safely cross dimensions and your true empire is reborn, only those who have proven themselves true to your cause may live in a universe that will doubtlessly be made yours...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_LOSS2           | Your schemes foiled, your quest endangered...#Your plans have been laid bare to the galaxy, and though none can hope to match your skill in subterfuge, the eyes of your rivals proved too watchful for even you to circumvent. With the forging of the New Republic and the future of the galaxy to be determined, the votes for those on the council floor have proven to unmake your well laid plans. The future belongs to the %6 race!#Attempting to gain the ability to steer the course of the galaxy was an ambitious strategy. Had your diplomatic machinations been subtler it is very possible that the entire will of the galaxy could have been bent to serving your quest. Now you will have to submit to the will of the %6 race, but every day that passes brings those stranded in the collapsing universe you come from one day closer to a fate more terrible than you dare to imagine...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | The end of your quest, the end of your people...#Fortune has never favored your people since your arrival into this unwelcoming plane. It did not favor you when you were flung to a dimension where none of your technology functioned properly. It did not favor you when the native denizens of this galaxy voted against you to lead the New Republic. And now, at the very end of all things, it did not favor you as you strike against your rivals to secure not just leadership of the galaxy, but your very survival.#Your people were tenacious, strong, and determined, but their best efforts and willingness to win by any means necessary simply were not enough to grant them victory against the overwhelming might of the New Republic's armies. Your bravery was worthy of remembrance: of that no one could argue. But as the last of your armies, and your very worlds, fall to your foes, your broken empire lies beaten, broken, and soon to be forgotten...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | The first phase finished, the true test begins...#Now at last these inferior fools see your power and will unleashed! In vain your enemies sought to impede you in the quest to free your stranded kin from their ultimate doom, and they used every trick they could to obstruct you. From threats to espionage to open hostility, their desire to prevent you from reaching your goal was at its apex when they voted against you to lead the New Republic despite you being the one worthiest to do so. With little choice and absent of a heavy conscience, you unleashed upon them the same dreadful fury that led your people to total dominance in the universe from whence you came.#Now this galaxy is yours, and though time is short before your home plane collapses and those left behind suffer a fate worse than death, at least now there are none left in this dimension who will oppose you. Now at last these inferior fools see your power and will unleashed! Or at least they would, if any of them were left alive to do so...
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | The first phase ended, the true test begins...#From the very beginning you knew that the denizens of this galaxy would never willingly trust you to lead a unified alliance of spacefaring empires. Dishonest and mistrustful, the native empires that inhabit this plane had done all they could to foil your plans, and gleefully voted against you when the New Republic's formation began. But you are wise, and you are cunning, and seeing their machinations as easily as one reads words on a page, you focused your diplomatic efforts only on those worthiest to stand beside you. And when the time came that your enemies thought they trapped you, they found themselves in a trap that had long since been sprung.#Now you and your allies stand victorious on the ashes of those who dared think themselves your betters. The fate of the galaxy is in your hands as you are free to find a way to bring your stranded kin across the dimensional barriers and into a new universe ripe for the taking. And should those you chose as comrades obstruct you from your goals, you will deal with them as decisively as you dealt with all the others...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_ALLIANCE_WIN2   | The first phase ended, the true test begins...#Long ago a small band of your people were flung from their dying universe and thrust into this new and alien plane. As you began to search for a way to bring those who were stranded to join you in this new and stable galaxy, your encounters with those who already dwelt among these stars taught you quickly that you would not be able to find the answers you sought while fighting petty and prolonged wars. Instead you sought to manipulate the course of history while veiled in shadows, and now at last those plans have come to fruition.#The %7 race has assumed mastery of the New Republic, and they have proven themselves malleable and receptive to your designs and your council. As confidants and advisors, your people are in a unique position to steer the power of the galaxy itself under the leadership of your ally. You are too far removed from direct authority to ever feel the backlash should things fail. If you succeed, the bolstering of your ranks by the arrival of your long-lost kin will be more than enough to begin a new age and tip the scales overwhelmingly in your favor...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_WIN2            | The first phase finished, the true test now begins...#The council chambers erupt in cheers as you begin your reign as Master of the New Republic. You humbly accept the burden of stewardship that has been granted to you by the empires that comprise the Galactic Council, knowing that this end was the result of a plan long in the making. Shortly after your people arrived in this dimension and learned of its mysteries, you knew that it would be impossible for you alone to find a way to enable your trapped brothers and sisters to make the journey to this plane before their universe collapsed entirely. Now, after years upon years of diplomacy, stealth, and political manipulation, you no longer have to.#Now, this galaxy is yours to shape and sculpt and steer along the course that seems best to you. You will soon bend the technology, strength, and innovation of your allies towards helping you open a portal to your home and re-build your civilization here with as many of your people as you can usher in. And should anyone dare to try and stop you, you now have the armies of the New Republic to crush their dissent once and for all...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_WIN2   | The first phase finished, the true test now begins...#Now your rule of this galaxy is vindicated in word and in deed. After countless years of manipulating your interstellar rivals into helping you advance your goals, your plans finally came to fruition when you gained the title "Master of the New Republic". And when the voices of your dissidents rose against you, you had already set into motion plans within plans that enabled you to quash the rebellion decisively. They fought, you won, and now the entire galaxy is yours to do with as you please.#With your enemies ground to dust and scattered upon the solar winds, you turn your attention to your true goal: to find a way to bring your sundered people across the dimensional chasm and into this new and stable universe where your empire can be reborn. No one would dare to speak out against you now, not after seeing what happened to those foolish enough to do so...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_LOSS2  | The end of your quest, the end of your people...#The saddest fate you could have achieved for your people has been made into reality. Your unmatched ability for subterfuge and manipulation has been foiled by inferior species who could not hope to understand the great work you were trying to accomplish. Though you succeeded in the monumental task of becoming the elected ruler of the galaxy while still maintaining the secrecy that shrouded your goals, you were unable to stifle the rebellion that soon rose up to meet your burgeoning rule.#Now it is too late for you to steer the future of the galaxy along the path you deem fit. The rebellion has left the New Republic as nothing more than ruins for the victors to loot and build over. And the death of the Darloks seals the fate of those who remain trapped in a doomed universe they have no hope of escaping. Your failure has sealed the fate of your empire in not one but two universes, and as such is more monumental than any of your enemies could even comprehend...
