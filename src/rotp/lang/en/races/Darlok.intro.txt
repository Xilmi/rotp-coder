The year is 31 PDB...

The Nazlok have finally achieved true order and stability after recovering from the chaos of the unexpected dimensional breach that brought them here. 
With their strange new physical forms on an even stranger new world, they finally decipher the scientific truths of this universe that will enable them to venture forth from Nazin. Still unable to re-establish communication with their home plane, your people instead bend their collective will to re-opening the door that brought them here. 
The need to expand into space is twofold: not only does the answer to creating this interdimensional bridge lay somewhere beyond their temporary home world, but in searching for it the Dralocks will attain the territory and resources required to sustain those who will make the crossing once it is opened. 
You are but one of many who stand united by this great burden to find both the way and the means to save your people from the impending disaster that threatens their original universe. No cost can be considered too high to achieve success, for failing this endeavor means nothing less than the total extinction of your entire race...
