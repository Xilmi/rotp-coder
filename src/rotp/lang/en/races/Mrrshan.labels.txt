MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | We've made contact with a new alien race! Think they'll prove to be strong enemies, or will their treasures be easy pickings?
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | We've found a way to improve our engines and make our ships even faster! If we incorporate them into our ship designs, our raids on enemy worlds will become even more efficient!

GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | Your cherished treasures now free for the taking...#The dread fleets of Khanate raiders that struck like lightning and claimed all in their path caused entire civilizations to fear to journey into regions previously unexplored. In your time, you took the wealth of entire cultures and added them to hordes that contained relics spanning hundreds of worlds. But it seems that through folly, arrogance, greed, or some combination of the three, your people finally found enemies who would prove their superiors in combat. And when these enemies took the offensive, you were powerless to prevent the doom that has now befallen you.#The mere rumor of your people once caused star systems, and those who dwelt in them, to quake in fear. Now your people have been wiped from this galaxy, remaining only as ghost stories to scare the children of the victors into submission. And your precious treasures, taken from so many worlds, have been stolen away and placed into wealthy homes and museums: now relics of the distant past, just like your people...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | The treasures of this galaxy are yours for the taking!#On this night, the entire surface of your homeworld erupts in roars celebrating your people's supreme victory. For this night is the first of the new age, where the Mrrshan Khanates alone now dominate the galaxy. What once began as simple raids for spoils and renown, an important cultural cornerstone for your people, eventually became full scale wars that spanned planets, star systems, and eventually the entirety of the known galaxy. Against all odds, and against all challengers, each and every rival empire has fallen beneath the weight of your overwhelming ferocity and power.#With weaker empires falling to you one by one, your people saw little need to make allies, and your rivals were driven too far past the point of fear to ally themselves with you in any meaningful way. Eschewing political entanglements and the woeful boredom of diplomacy, you have dominated the last of the strongholds that stood against you, and the loot of a thousand worlds now lies unguarded and yours for the taking. And when this galaxy has given all the spoils it has, woe to those who dwell in the stars even further beyond. They shall quake at your coming, and their loot shall be yours as well...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | The spoils of this galaxy for you and your allies...#Your raids and wars have finally borne glittering fruits of worth beyond measure. From the very beginning of your foray into diplomacy with strange and alien powers, it became evident that your proud culture would never be able to coexist peacefully with those who held such wondrous treasures without the strength to defend them. The wars you knew would be inevitable. What surprised you however, was finding others in the depths of space who not only had the strength to defend their own spoils, but an interest in adding to their own coffers as well.#Together you and your allies waged wars the likes of which will be spoken of in legend until the very end of time. You shared in conquest, and shared in riches, and as the bodies of your frail enemies lie broken along the path to the future, you have only to divide up your spoils and revel in the obstacles you have overcome. But a word of warning, Golden Khan: no matter how staunchly your allies fought alongside you, those with eyes of gold may land their gaze upon their friends when there are no more enemies with treasure ripe for the taking...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_LOSS2        | Your raids, and your way of life, have come to an abrupt end...#The greatest threat to the culture of your people has finally been realized. After countless years of exploring space and conquering the stars, the various empires that comprise this galaxy have decided to forgo the feuds of the past and join together in a united co-existence henceforth known as the New Republic. And as all new ages deserve new leaders, the Galactic Council has chosen one to guide them into this new age. Suffice it to say, they did not choose you.#Though you tried your best to play the game of diplomacy, harmonious co-existence has never been the forte of your people. The distrust that spawned from news of your raids, or even old wounds inflicted from being on the receiving end of them, caused diplomatic standing to become irrevocably damaged amongst the empires that comprise the council. With the unity of the galaxy now a certainty that you cannot hope to circumvent, your raids for treasure and glory have now come to a permanent end. Your people must adapt to this new age, or die trying to do so...
GAME_OVER_ALLIANCE_WIN2           | Your spoils, at least, will be safe in this new age...#It comes as a shock to no one that the Galactic Council would fail to see your greatness and refuse to grant you leadership of the New Republic. Your raids on other empires have made your people a terrifying legend, and few are even capable of looking past your cultural norms to understand your people on a truly meaningful level. But whether through naivete or the sense of genuineness that has won other so many others to their cause, you were able to find common ground with the %6 race, and knowing that it would be the best move for your people, have helped to elect them as leaders of the coming age.#In gratitude and with graciousness, the %6 race has been able to secure the safety of your spoils without needing you to pay reparations to those you had taken them from. As part of brokering this peace, you have reluctantly agreed to end the practice of raiding in your culture, and now must explore new paths to harness your people's desires. But surely this is better than the future of certain annihilation that you would face if you had chosen to rebel against your ally. For in building your terrifying legend, you were able to add so very many treasures to your hoard...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | Your cherished treasures now free for the taking...#The days of your people plundering this galaxy of its most wondrous of treasures have come to an end. With the formation of the New Republic and the unifying of the galaxy under the banner of the %6 race, you knew that the sacred rites of your people's culture would be doomed if you did not take the only action available to you: open rebellion against the coming of this misguided new age. But, whether in blind obedience to the idealism that they hoped the future would bring or because of the fear of your people and the reputation they have earned throughout the galaxy, in this rebellion you stood alone.#Your rivals, knowing that none could hope to meet your people in a fair fight and walk away victorious, instead pooled their resources and their fleets as they stood shoulder to shoulder against your rebellion. Though your people fought with the legendary tenacity that has inspired fear throughout the galaxy, neither they nor you could hope to outmatch the combined forces of the New Republic. Now your rebellion comes to a most unfortunate end, and all that is left for the victors is to claim for themselves your spoils...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | The treasures of this galaxy are yours for the taking!#The time of the Khanates has come at last. From the very beginning of your foray into the uncharted galaxy, you encountered other space-faring civilizations who sought their own goals among the sea of stars. Yet despite their advanced cultures and technological innovations, all have now fallen before you and your unmatched ferocity. Initially you had been more than content to let these civilizations continue on as they had been, allowing your people endless sources of breathtaking treasure to win for their own in the raids. But when they decided to form a new union in what was doubtlessly an attempt to prevent your people to continue their very way of life, you took the only response fitting to those who would dare oppose you.#With your cunning, skill, and tenacity on the battlefield brought to bear against the fleets of your rival empires, your rebellion against the new galactic order has ended in complete and total victory. The loot of thousands of worlds lies open and undefended, for those who had guarded it have been removed from your path with your own hands. Take them, Golden Khan, add to your trove, and prepare your people for the loot that lies in galaxies beyond...
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | The spoils of this galaxy for you and your allies...#It was no easy decision to raise your banner in rebellion against the New Republic. You knew the galaxy thought little of your people and of their way of life. As stories of your martial prowess and the terrifying raids you had performed on rival empires spread throughout the galaxy, you knew that a united galactic order would pose an insurmountable threat to you once it had been formed. Like a true leader from the legends of your ancient people, you acted faster than others could predict and struck against this order in open war, and in doing so prevented your enemies from finding the footing they would need to overwhelm the fleets of the Khanate.#To your great pleasure, you found others dissatisfied with the shape the future was beginning to take, and in an exchange for a small share of the spoils, you forged a new alliance that helped you assert dominance over the woefully ill-prepared forces that assembled themselves against you. Your rivals have been obliterated entirely, and the allies you made will stand no chance against your might should they ever cease to be useful to you...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_WIN2         | This galaxy and its treasures belong to you and you alone!#The grandest day in the history of your people has come at last: the Golden Khan of the Mrrshan now sits atop the throne of the New Republic and reigns supreme over all other empires in the galaxy. From the very beginning, your people made a terrifying reputation for themselves as they raided neighboring empires for loot, and though many outcries have been made against you in the past, all voices fall silent as the Galactic Council recognizes in you a strength that simply cannot be overcome. Surely some of the empires who helped elect you hope to become genuine friends of your people, but you know that the majority of those who put you here did so out of the fear of your swift reprisal. And you would not have it any other way!#From this day forward, all empires in the New Republic shall pay you tribute. And for the crime of trying to oppose you in the council chambers, the empires who voted against you will forevermore be subject to raids by your people, never again to gain the power they would need to rise against you. The galaxy belongs to the Mrrshan, and it will continue to remain subservient to you until the very end of time. Hail the new age, and hail the Golden Khan!
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_WIN2       | The spoils of this galaxy for you and your allies...#Now your glorious reign can truly begin. The legendary prowess of your people on the battlefield and the stories of the terrible raids you carried out on rival empires were more than enough for the Galactic Council to appoint you as leader of the New Republic. But even though many feared arousing your ire enough to fall in line with your wishes, there were still those too foolish to be swayed who rose up against your power. Eager to take ownership on their treasure and add it to their growing hordes, your people surged forth to crush the rebellion and claim their reward, this time with support from the entire united military of the New Republic you now rule.#The rebellion was over before it even truly began, and the armies of the usurpers were crushed with minimal effort. With their treasures gathered, the Mrrshan rifle through the spoils, tossing out the rubbish to be given as rewards to the lesser empires that serve you. With the rebels serving as an example of what happens to those who displease you, there is little reason for you to believe that any rival will ever make themselves known again. Turn your attention now to other galaxies, for they have hapless prey waiting to be hunted, and even more shimmering treasures to add to your collection...
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_LOSS2      | Your cherished treasures now free for the taking...#Your rule has ended before it could even truly begin. Though initially you were able to use fear to crush the dissent of your rival empires and assume leadership of the New Republic, there were those brave enough to stand against you and the merciless future that you represented. Your people were proud and strong, decorated with the spoils of countless raids and eager to add more treasures from another inevitable conquest. But they did not, or could not, see the danger the rebellion represented, and the steadfast courage that the rebels displayed would prove to be your end.#Though you boasted superior numbers in utilizing the fleets of those you had strong-armed into submission, you were unable to stop the insurrection from destabilizing the republic and casting down your claim to the throne. First fell your subordinates, and then fell your people, and it seems in the end the galaxy itself chose against the future that you had prepared. For what is the will of one people, no matter how strong, against the indomitable hand of fate after all...
