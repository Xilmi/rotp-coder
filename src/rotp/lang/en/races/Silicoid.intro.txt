The Cryslonoid Imperium
The year is 12414...
As the Imperium ends its search of Cryslon's desiccated surface, the Cryslonoid find themselves unable to locate even the remotest trace of their eternal enemy Quaralon and his nefarious brood. 
As the sole inhabitants of a planet otherwise entirely devoid of life, the Cryslonoids know that they must now leave their homeworld to locate their foes and, hopefully, eliminate them once and for all. In the hopes of dealing a devastating first strike to the children of Quaralon, the Cryslonoids have rushed to develop the technology that will enable them to traverse the infinite Sea of Worlds. 
As the reigning Crystal Emperor, you have galvanized the Cryslonoids from all walks of life on this noble crusade against a faceless nemesis, and prepared every facet of the Imperium to do whatever is necessary to expunge the threat of your ancient foe. 
Should your people succeed, all life in the galaxy will rejoice in your victory. Should your people fail, the toll of your defeat will be more terrible than you can even comprehend...
